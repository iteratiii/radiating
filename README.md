# radiating

Inspired by Kathy Acker in *Dead Doll Humility*:

> “To her, every word wasn't only material in itself, but also sent out like beacons, other words. Blue sent out heaven and The Virgin. Material is rich. I didn't create language, writer thought. [...] I'm constantly being given language. Since this language-world is rich and always changing, flowing, when I write, I enter a world which has complex relations and is, perhaps, illimitable. This world both represents and is human history, public memories and private memories turned public, the records and actualizations of human intentions. This world is more than life and death, for here life and death conjoin. I can't make language, but in this world, I can play and be played. [...]

> A writer who had found his own voice presented a viewpoint. Created meaning. The writer took a certain amount of language, verbal material, forced that language to stop radiating in multiple, even unnumerable directions, to radiate in only one direction so there could be his meaning. [...] The writer's voice was a process, how he had forced the language to obey him, his will. The writer's voice is the voice of the writer-as-God.
>
> Writer thought, Don't want to be God; have never wanted to be God. [...] Want to play. Be left alone to play.”

What does language look like when we play with it and allow its meaning to continue radiating in every direction?

This Raspberry Pi script iterates on a spoken sentence, replacing each word of the original sentence with a rhyme, and then each word with a synonym, then reading them out loud in a gradually overlapping chorus.
